# Hang in There  

### Abstract:

We built a inspirational poster generator that allows users to create a poster, either from random generation or from their own input. They can also save, access, and delete their saved posters, and return to the home page from either of the alternate views.

### Installation Instructions:

To get this app running, clone it down from [GitHub](https://github.com/jayceeannne/hang-in-there) under the "<> Code" dropdown. Open it from your terminal or preferred CLI with `git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>`. Move into the directory, open the file in your code editor of choice, and you'll have everything you need! The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using `open index.html` in your terminal.

### Context:

This project is from Week 2, Mod 1 of the Turing Front End Engineering program, completed 2.5 days from assignment.

### Contributors:

This application was created by [Jaycee Rodriguez](https://github.com/jayceeannne/) and [Arden Ranta](https://github.com/tenthwalker/).

### Learning Goals:

The learning goals of this project were to:
    1. Write clean, DRY JavaScript, building functionality with SRP functions and manipulating DOM elements.
    2. Initiate an understanding of the connection between HTML, CSS,and JavaScript.
    3. Build an understanding of collaborative code writing, particularly through code reviews, teamwork, and Git Workflow best practices.

These were accomplished on MacBook Pros using GitHub, VS Code, Google Chrome, the Mac Terminal, and Slack.

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins:
    1. We managed to get the project done in the timeline we set for ourselves, and did not have to rush last minute.
    2. We prioritized taking care of ourselves during production, taking breaks and seeking help as needed.

Challenges:
    1. Both of us felt frustration around the volume of technical vocabulary introduced during the week of the project, and sometimes struggled to find answers to our questions due to not having the right search keywords.
    2. Several small bugs in our code required fresh eyes to come in and diagnose, as we were overwhelmed from looking at our broken code for long periods of time.
